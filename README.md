It is a program make with python3.8 & PyQt5 
It help Architecture to arrange their AutoDesk 3DMAX liberary files

programe take path to folder and it coupling the preview picture with 
the inner folder which contain the 3dMax file and compress the folder 
then it rename the folder and zipfile and picture with a uniqe name 

For Ex:
if we have folder named Carpets which contain tons of pictures and modules
we input the path to Carpets.
the program compress all uncompressed modules then rename

result should be:

Car0.jpg Car0.zip Car0
Car1.jpg Car1.zip Car1

but if picture found without module it will be still the same name cause 
the program rename only two or more files.
